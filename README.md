## Overview

Challenges i faced in this project:

<strong>1. 'Meet the team' section</strong>

   The photo profile part is kinda hard to make it responsive. This boi take the most of my energy haha. but finally did it with grid
   

<strong>2. The card active marker on hover</strong>

   It's a little challenging, but finally did it with JavaScript
   

<strong>3. The menu</strong>

   Not really, its kinda easy with JavaScript
