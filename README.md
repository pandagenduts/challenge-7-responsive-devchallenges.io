<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

I faced a lot of challenge in this project:
1. 'Meet the team' section, 
\tThe photo profile part is kinda hard to make it responsive. but finally did it with grid

2. The card active marker on hover
\tIt's a little challenging, but finally did it with JavaScript

Check the [demo](https://bejewelled-florentine-50e6d4.netlify.app/) on how i did it :)
